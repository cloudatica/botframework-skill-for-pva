# Sample code for botframework skill for pva (copilot studio)
For using it, make following updates:

- update .env
- update manifest file under manifest folder
- update activityRouterDialog under dialogues folder. I have a dummy weather activity that just gives dummy response


Before adding as skill in Copilot Studio, you have to give manifest url.

In app registration in Azure, make sure to have homepage url same as the manifest file url
